  Deep Learning Programming in Fintech Practices (I) at National Yang Ming Chiao Tung University is designed for students who are interested in programming, deep learning, and their applications in the financial industry.

  This course is split into two parts: technical skills and fintech lectures. The technical skills classes will cover topics ranging from basic Python programming to deep learning concepts, and will also include in-class lab sessions on deep learning.

  Additionally, we have invited experts from the field to give lectures on the real-world applications of fintech technology. These lectures will provide students with a deeper understanding of how the concepts they learn in class can be applied in the industry.

  To challenge the students' knowledge, this class also includes a group final project, where students will be asked to identify a problem or opportunity in the fintech field, come up with a product or solution, and even a business model to address it. By the end of the course, students will have a comprehensive understanding of deep learning and its practical applications in the financial industry.
