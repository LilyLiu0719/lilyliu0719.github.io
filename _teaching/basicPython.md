  This beginner-friendly Python boot camp contained an 8-week course designed for those with little to no programming experience. Each week, you will have 3 hours of instruction, for a total of 24 hours of in-depth Python training. Our expert instructors will guide you through the fundamentals of Python, including variables, data structures, control flow, and functions. You will also learn about more advanced concepts such as working with libraries and modules.

  One of the highlights of the course is the final project, where students will work on implementing Conway's Game of Life using Python. This project gave students the opportunity to apply what they've learned and gain valuable hands-on experience. This boot camp is designed to give students a solid foundation in Python so that they will be ready to take on more advanced topics in the future.
