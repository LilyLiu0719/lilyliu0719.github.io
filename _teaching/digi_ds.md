  This 3-day camp was designed to give participants a comprehensive introduction to the field of data science, from the basics of the Python programming language to advanced modules such as NumPy, Pandas, and Matplotlib.

  Throughout the camp, we covered a variety of algorithms used in data science, including Principal Component Analysis (PCA), Support Vector Machines (SVM), K-means, decision trees, and random forests. Additionally, we delved into the exciting world of machine learning and deep learning, exploring their concepts and applications.

  To put what students learn into practice, the camp included a group final project, where students were asked to identify a real-world problem or opportunity in the market and come up with a solution using data science techniques. By the end of the camp, participants gained a solid foundation in data science and be well-equipped to continue their learning journey in the field.
