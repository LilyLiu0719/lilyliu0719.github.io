  Python is a widely-used programming language that is known for its versatility and power. In this camp, we led students through the process of implementing a maze solver using the breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm. Students were divided into groups of two and given a template code that had several "TODO" sections that needed to be filled in. The task was to use the BFS algorithm to solve the mazes as quickly as possible. The instructors provided guidance and instruction on how to use Python to implement the BFS algorithm, fill in the TODOs in the template code and navigate the maze. In addition to learning about the BFS algorithm and its application, students also gained a deeper understanding of Python and its capabilities. They learned how to manage data, utilize control structures and functions, and implement object-oriented programming concepts.

  The camp provided hands-on experience and an opportunity for students to see the practical applications of the concepts they were learning. Teams were able to test and compare their maze solvers against each other and see which one was the fastest. At the end of the camp, students presented their completed maze solvers to the instructors and their peers, gaining the opportunity to see the different approaches other teams used. And this overall experience provides a great learning opportunity for the students to learn Python, enhance their problem-solving skills, and improve the efficiency of their code.
