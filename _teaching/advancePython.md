  Our advanced Python class is designed specifically for students who have a solid foundation in Python and are looking to take their skills to the next level.

  This class, which is 6 weeks long with 3 hours of instruction per class, is designed to dive deeper into more advanced topics in Python programming. We started with advanced object-oriented programming concepts, such as creating and working with custom classes. You also learn about frequently used libraries like NumPy and Matplotlib which are used for scientific computation and data visualization. The final project of this class is to design and implement a virtual Pokemon backpack, which gives the student hands-on experience in implementing their python application and an opportunity to showcase their creativity.
